    How should the text be?

    What problems does this solve?

    This solves the problem of people being able to write text in a way that it is accessible for everyone. People reading it can configure how much detail they want to read that in and read it in that detail.

    There is one stage in which we are going to have to create demand. 

    What is the potential of this component?

    What is the potential of this component for me? What can I benefit from creating this? Specifically how can I benefit financially from this creation?

    I should not make everything GPL just because everyone else does it. I want to benefit from my labor.

    What will that mean in terms of creating demand?

    We have to make this available widely so that people feel good using it. But in order to integrate this into some one else's code base they will have to buy a license from me.
