1. The first mock up.






Notes

We don't want to right away create the generic component, Let's worry about that later. That thinking is getting in the way
 of the otucome. We are only concerned about coding for outcome. Only that.

 After creating this tool, we may not have to do that much on-going development. It can stop at one point. This is such
 a great idea that we only need to keep the project fresh after that.


Working backwards from the day we have moved on to new project:

 - We have put things in place that will give the impression that this project is fresh and maintained
 - We have made it braindead easy for people to buy a license to this product on our website.
 - We have figured out the right pricing for this tool to be used in selling licenses.


Log:

We have made the web page. The web page is showing the interactions for how to trigger the drill down. I am happy that I did this
We should take this approach for everything we want to do now. This will be a practice that we do for a while. Creating mock-ups
for everything we want to create. Take shortcuts and develop them quickly.

I like to think of this whole experience as an effort in innovation. What do we have in life if not innovation.

I want to execute this well.

Creating that email autoresponder is also not that much effort. It just took a long time for us becuase of the way we did it.

So this is us now. We create independent software.

The implementation is not exactly reusable but that is fine becusae we only want to be able to clarify the ideas in our mind.

Remember we developed all this in windows the last itme.

I feel a bit lost about this. This feels a bit underwhelming. But this is not the thing we are making. The presentation makes all the difference in the world.

We are not merely making a UI element, we are making a file format. I dare say we are making a proprietary application. Embedding this in other applications will cost money.

It will be in our best interest to make it so that most people can use this application for free. We stand to gain from having most people
use it and it becoming a literal standard. We can even add the option of having a premium version of the desktop applications with some features not enabled.

Won't this again be a case of giving away too much?

In order for this to be a minimum viable release, we have to release the editor as well. Perhaps in the same component.

If you think about the prospect of allowing people to embed body of text in desktop applications - it seems low priority at the moment.

I would encourage you to not look at this presentation as anything bad. It is good. You are pre-judging this. 

Isn't the main stay of this tool a way to give drill downs. Alternatively we can offer a way to create a side pane where 
they can open some context on the thing that they are reading. 

Utmost I can see ourselves having to support some kind of metas. Meaning, we define ranges of things using tags. 

## Presentation is important


## Tasks backwards from v0.1

1. We deploy the website
2. We will have created a stand along node module that will work on its own
3. 


# Wishlist / NICE TO HAVE:

1. Create a jetbarins plugin for BOT. 
The timelien for this MVP is what?

We can't take forever.
